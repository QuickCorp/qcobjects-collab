# QCObjects Collab
------------------------------------

## Collab for Data Science

QCObjects Collab is a tool that helps you to make data science math using JavaScript

You can use a TCP socket to connect yourself to the engine:

> ssh user@0.0.0.0 nc 0.0.0.0 10300

You can also use a Unix Socket to connect yourself to the engine:

> ssh user@0.0.0.0 nc -U /tmp/qcobjects-unix-socket

(change "user" for whathever your username is!)


[QCObjects](https://qcobjects.dev) is an Open-source framework that empowers full-stack developers to make micro-services and micro-frontends into an N-Tier architecture.

With QCObjects devlopers are also able to code front-end and back-end together using a common syntax in pure JavaScript. It is cross-browser, cross-platform and cross-frame.

[QCObjects is being featured by British Herald as today, the most advanced framework for modern software development.](https://britishherald.com/qcobjects-the-first-world-class-tech-framework-made-in-south-america-is-meant-to-make-developers-happier-while-they-code/)
